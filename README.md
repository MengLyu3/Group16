Medical Insurance Costs

Medical expenses are hard to estimate since there will always be random conditions. But some situations are more prevalent among the population covered by the people. For example, from everyday observation, smokers are more likely to get lung cancers than non-smokers. Our goal is to estimate average medical expenses base on multiple linear regression using the medical insurance dataset.
